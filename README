SSL inspection is a "man-in-the-middle" (MitM) attack, where a network device intercepts and decrypts your encrypted internet traffic. It’s bad for your privacy but there is no way to bypass it because it's server sided. The follwoing guide will only show you how to install a ssl certificate to ingore and bypass the annoying "Your connection is not secure." warning


❗ If you have a new device and you want to connect to the school network follow this guide.
❗ If you are getting a https error (your connection is not private), follow this guide
❗ Before you start make sure to delete all exististing certificates as they might be expired and could cause conflict.

- How it works:
    - **Intercept Traffic:** The network device steps in between your computer and the website you’re visiting.
    - **Decrypt Data:** It decrypts (or unlocks) the encrypted data to look for anything harmful or suspicious.
    - **Inspect Data:** The device checks the decrypted data for security threats or policy violations.
    - **Re-encrypt and Forward:** After inspection, the device re-encrypts (or locks) the data and sends it to the website, and vice versa.

- **Why a Certificate is Needed:**
    
    When SSL inspection is enabled, the network device essentially acts as a "man-in-the-middle" between the user's device and the website. Without proper handling, this can trigger security warnings on the user's device, such as "Your connection is not secure." This happens because the browser detects that the certificate presented by the network device is not the original certificate from the website.
    
    To avoid these warnings, the network device generates its own SSL/TLS certificate and presents it to the user's device.
