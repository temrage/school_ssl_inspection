# üö® Connecting to the School Network
The school network has SSL inspection enabled to monitor encrypted traffic and block sites. This can cause security warnings on your device, such as "Your connection is not private," because the network‚Äôs SSL certificate is not trusted by default. You cannot bypass ssl inspection when using the school network because it's server sided. (you can use a vpn tho)

‚ùó **This guide is for:**  
- New device users trying to connect to a school network.
- Anyone receiving HTTPS errors (like "Your connection is not private").
  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Before starting**:  
Make sure to delete all existing certificates to avoid conflicts due to expired certificates!

## üîë **Why a Certificate is Needed**:

When SSL inspection is enabled, the network device acts as a MitM between the user and the website. This can trigger security warnings (e.g., "Your connection is not secure") because the certificate presented by the network device isn't the website's original certificate. To avoid these warnings, the school has generated its own SSL/TLS certificate, which you‚Äôll need to install on your device.

üì• **Download the latest certificate here:**  
[ssl.crt](https://github.com/temrage/school_ssl_inspection/releases/download/release/ssl.crt)
This certificate will expire on 15/4/2025, once the school releases a new one it will be updated over here.
