# üö® SSL Inspection Bypass Guide

SSL inspection is essentially a **"man-in-the-middle" (MitM)** attack, where a network device intercepts and decrypts your encrypted internet traffic. This process can jeopardize your privacy, and while it‚Äôs something you can't completely bypass due to its server-sided nature, this guide shows how to install an SSL certificate to **ignore** and **bypass** the persistent "Your connection is not secure" warnings.

‚ùó **This guide is for:**  
- New device users trying to connect to a school network.
- Anyone receiving HTTPS errors (like "Your connection is not private").
  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Before starting**:  
Make sure to delete all existing certificates to avoid conflicts due to expired certificates!

## üîç **How SSL Inspection Works**:

1. **Intercept Traffic**: The network device steps in between your device and the website you‚Äôre visiting.
2. **Decrypt Data**: The device decrypts the encrypted data to check for anything suspicious.
3. **Inspect Data**: The decrypted data is scanned for security threats or policy violations.
4. **Re-encrypt & Forward**: After inspection, the device re-encrypts the data and forwards it to the website, completing the loop.

## üîë **Why a Certificate is Needed**:

When SSL inspection is enabled, the network device acts as a MitM between the user and the website. This can trigger security warnings (e.g., "Your connection is not secure") because the certificate presented by the network device isn't the website's original certificate. 

To avoid these warnings, the network device generates its own SSL/TLS certificate, which you‚Äôll need to install on your device.
